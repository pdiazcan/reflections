# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It converts the directory into a repository, creating the new hidden directory .git
It's the first step to start tracking versions...

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
# What value do you think it offers?

The working directory includes the last version of all the files in the directory, 
but staging area only those we choose to track and commit.
It lets us group files logically, and work in different stages in each of those groups.
