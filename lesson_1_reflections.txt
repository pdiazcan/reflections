# How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file 
# help you see the bug that was introduced?

It focused on just the differences between both versions, 
making it easier to compare and find the bug. 
It made me look to ten lines of code, instead of ten thousand, so to speak.

# How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
# make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It allows you to track your evolution, as well as the file evolution.
In case something go wrong with a program, you can easily go back 
to the last working version... or even rescue some old idea that wasn't
appropiate for the old version, but maybe now it fits!

# What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
# when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
# automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: You choose the most relevant versions, bug-free. 
And you can document the changes you've made.
Cons: It's up to you when to commit, and you can forget to commit,
or choose random points to commit...

# Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
# allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
# like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it's because they have different goals, and each of them
deal with different situation: On Google Docs you usually work 
on a single file, while in Git you're working on a project.

# How can you use the commands git log 
# and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use git log to browse all the different versions of the files,
commented (so you easily see what was changed in that version).
You can use git diff to see the exact differences between two versions.

# How might using version control make you more confident 
# to make changes that could break something?

Well... I can always revisit older versions of the code and pin-point
what was that broke the code... 
If I break something, I can always go back in time...

# Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would love to start using Git to do version control of my projects.
A bit intimidating, though
