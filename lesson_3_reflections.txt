# When would you want to use a remote repository 
# rather than keeping all your work local?
Specially when you are collaborating with other people.
But also if you want to have a backup, or work in different computers.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
# having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To control the changes made, and check if the remote version conflict 
with the local repository. On the other hand, you may want to keep 
work-in-progress unpublished until you're satisfied with the performance.
