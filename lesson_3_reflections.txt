# When would you want to use a remote repository 
# rather than keeping all your work local?
Specially when you are collaborating with other people.
But also if you want to have a backup, or work in different computers.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
# having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To control the changes made, and check if the remote version conflict 
with the local repository. On the other hand, you may want to keep 
work-in-progress unpublished until you're satisfied with the performance.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
# When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone of a GitHub repository, done directly on GitHub.
It tracks the original repository.
A clone is a copy of a repository, local or otherwise.
A branch is a line of changes in any repository, it relates to the commits
made in a same repository, but allows you to work in parallel in different 
aspects of your code.
I'd use a branch to manage my workflow in a project. 
I'd use a clone to start a totally different project but based on an existing one.
I'd use a fork to experiment with other people's projects, and maybe try 
the viability of new ideas before suggesting them to the original authors.
